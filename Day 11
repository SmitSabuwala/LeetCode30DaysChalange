Diameter of Binary Tree
Solution
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Answer:-

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    class Val{
        int ht;
        int dia;
    }
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        return getVal(root).dia;
    }
    
    public Val getVal(TreeNode node){
        if(node==null){
            Val val=new Val();
            val.ht=0;
            val.dia=0;
                
                return val;
        }
        Val left=getVal(node.left);
        Val right=getVal(node.right);
        
        int dia=left.ht+right.ht;
        int ht=Math.max(left.ht,right.ht)+1;
        Val result=new Val();
        result.ht=ht;
        result.dia=Math.max(dia,Math.max(left.dia,right.dia));
        
        return result;
    }
}
